# Anomaly-based Malware Detection in Android Applications

## Abstract
In the current era of stable and cheaper internet access, most users have shifted from desktop-centric applications to mobile applications. 90 percent of the global users use smartphones to access the internet and 70 percent of the market is captured by Android applications. The users share and exchange their information on the Android applications and create loopholes for their own information by using free-of-cost applications that attackers create to track and steal the private data of the user using malware. The leakage of personal information creates security issues, digital harassment, etc.

In this project, we propose to create a Heuristic anomaly detection model which detects the presence of malware in an Android application and warns the user at the time of installation.
We plan to train our model on the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity datasets (https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/index.html). The dataset is in the form of apk files, we plan to process these files using the tools - Androguard and FlowDroid for the text extraction of the Activities, Permissions, Services, API calls performed by the application. After the extraction, various data processing, feature selection techniques need to be applied before the training of the ML model. We will partition the dataset into training and test datasets and then showcase the performance of our model on the test dataset.
